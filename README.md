# EBS-Metadata-Repo-Importer
This utility automates the process of importing files 
into the metadata repository for Oracle E-Business Suite installations. 

After setting the rootpath, import.bat directory, and directory paths 
containing the files to upload, you can run the script
to import xml files into the metadata repository.
